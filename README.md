A software for 3D point cloud data hole repair.
## Other
This projct is a C++ and OpenGL practice several years ago, so the code is not elegant.

I upload it to github only for storage. Any questions please let me kown, but I can't sure whether I can answer them or not for the old code in several years ago.
